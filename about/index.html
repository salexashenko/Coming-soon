    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p><a href="https://x.com/lulumeservey">Lulu Cheng Meservey</a>, <a href="https://x.com/salexashenko">Sergey
            Alexashenko</a> and <a href="https://x.com/toyaholness">Toya Holness</a> help founders go direct with their
        comms.</p>
    <p>Here are some nice things people have said about us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ilya Sutskever: "Unprecedented communication"</li>
        <li>Palmer Luckey: "Lulu was instrumental in putting Anduril on the map and I couldn't imagine our
            trajectory without her help."</li>
        <li>Sam Altman: "Lulu is one of the few people who actually understands how communication works in the
            current world. This alone would be extremely valuable, but she also has a deeply strategic lens, courage,
            excellent instincts on when to do what, and a very clear style."</li>
        <li>Brian Armstrong: "Going Direct is the right strategy for comms in today's world. And Lulu basically
            created the movement."</li>
        <li>Nat Friedman: "Lulu's work is a masterclass. She's simply the best in the world."</li>
        <li>Scott Wu: "Rostra is the best in the business. They've worked with us from before the Devin launch
            and has been deeply helpful every step of the way."</li>
        <li>Mikey Shulman: "A+. 3 Sigma above the mean."</li>
        <li>David Holz: "Whenever I need comms advice I go to Lulu, she's the best!"</li>
    </ul>
